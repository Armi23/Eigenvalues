Our package relies on the numpy as scipy packages. If you do not already have them installed, the packages for these modules can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi 

Import the Project file to access the submethods that are our modules to call our functions. We have also placed all of our tests into the project file so simply running this file will run the tests. Please note some tests print results while others check for true and false before printing the result because of their instability. 

Explanations for individual functions can be found in the code, and also in our report.

These are only the parts of a total mini-mathematica project that I was involved with as a final project. The rest of the project belongs to my partners, therefore I do not wish to share it without their permission
